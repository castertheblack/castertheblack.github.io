        <p>
            I have never had an actual job but I have taken many classes in school that give me expeerience.
            In middle school I took all of the stem cources avalible so I have expirence in engineering, robotics, computers, and fabrication.
            Then in highschool I have taken computer science.

        <p>
            As far as computer science goes I am skilled in python and only python but I would say im pretty good.
            I am good at figuring out solutions to problems which can be very relevant in cs.

            Acheivements
        </h2>
        <p>
            I have not won anything relevant to any carear I plan to pursue. I got second place at a
            horse driving competition, so if we are ever on one of those horse tours and the driver dies I will
            be very convient to have around.
