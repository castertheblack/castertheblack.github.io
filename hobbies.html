        <p>
            I like playing video games. I've recently been playing CDDA and counter srtike. I enjoy playing games 
            becuase it is fun in of itself but it also takes me out of my daily life. It also lets me do things with friends.

        <p>
            I play the guitar. I think it is fun because I get to create my own music.
            Also I get to play songs and hear that something I learned how to play can sound good.
