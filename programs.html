            <br>this is a game of connect 4 that can be played and there is an ai aswell if you add a 0 to the list on line 31
        </p> 
        <h2>
            2048 Ai
        </h2>

            <iframe width = "90%" height = "300px" src = "https://replit.com/@7thIntroCS/2048-CooperScogin?embed=true"></iframe>
            <br>this is another ai that will play 2048 but it is really slow becuase it iterates far too much and also it doesnt want to display properly because there is a ui window that appears and i dont know why
        </p>
        <h2>
            Hangman with helper
        </h2>

            <iframe width = "90%" height = "400px" src= "https://replit.com/@APCSPSeventh/Hangman-Tkinter-CooperScogin?embed=true"></iframe>
            <br>This is the hit game hangman and in the console it will also say the "best" letter to pick at any given time but you can also ignore that and play normally
