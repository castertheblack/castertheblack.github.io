            <b>Keyboards</b>
            <br> June third 1997 was the first day a keboard was in the white house and since then there has always been at least one
            this record came close to being stopped in 2007 when a coup was attempted to pull all keyboards out of the presidential building
            in favor of wiimotes, this was prompty stopped when preident Johanes pulled out his freedom rifle
            and shot the cia ( who was attempting the coup) and there has never been a word spoken of it since
            and there never will be
